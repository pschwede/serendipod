                <title>50 Hip-Hop Records for 50 Years of Hip-Hop Mix</title>
                <description>Just fifty favorite records of mine that I happen to own in vinyl in no particular order. Mostly 90s &#39;backpacker&#39; type stuff - it&#39;s a reflection of when I was collecting at the time, and doesn&#39;t necessarily represent all my favorite artists or favorite songs, many of which never were released on vinyl. I&#39;ve never made a mix this long, and admittedly I ended up doing it in three separate parts. There was no real planning besides making sure I played 50 different records. Hope you dig it!
