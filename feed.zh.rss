                <description>It’s never too late to learn to quilt!  Juanita Roby is in her 80’s and learned to quilt not even 10 years ago.  I was so happy to have the opportunity to visit with Juanita and share our enjoyment of quilting.
This is the quilt that Juanita said she named Nightmare.
Her favorite type of quilt - Dutch Girl / Boy
