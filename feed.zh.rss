                <title>309 Crime Adjacent, with Lindsay Sharman </title>
                <description>&lt;strong&gt;We&#39;re back on our Patreon live zoom for this episode, and joining in the fun and frolics is writer and podcaster, Lindsay Sharman, whose own life of crime displays more of a wrong place at the wrong time vibe than clear intent, but has landed her in just as much hot water, so it&#39;s no surprise that the bad company she keeps means she has a keen eye for getting to the root of criminal behaviour...
