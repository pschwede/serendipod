                <title>Andrée Blouin: Central Africa&#39;s unsung heroine (rerun)</title>

We look at her life, legacy and how colonial law impacted her experiences: from growing up in an orphanage, to losing her son from a treatable illness. Blouin used her experiences to advocate for women&#39;s rights both against traditional customs and European imperialism. How did she end up on the periphery of post-independent African history?
