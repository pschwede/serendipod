                <title>KNOW YOUR GEAR! (Phil McKnight Interview)</title>
                <description>Phil McKnight is one of the most popular content creators in the guitar gear space. He&#39;s been spreading his knowledge of gear on YouTube for around a decade now, and yet... There is still a LOT that people don&#39;t know about Phil himself. So we dive into the Phil McKnight story pretty heavily on this episode and uncover how all of this unfolded for him.
It&#39;s a pretty crazy story that not very many people know, so give this a listen and enjoy!
