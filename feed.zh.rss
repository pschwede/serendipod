                <title>Media Systems, Digital Media, and the Hybridity Cycle, with Prof. Daniel Hallin</title>
                <description>Professor Daniel C. Hallin, Distinguished Professor of Communication at UC San Diego, shares his thoughts on media systems and how digital media relates to the concept. We discuss the components of a &#39;system&#39; and current debates around the concept of &#39;hybridity&#39; in media studies.
