                <title>The promise of a miracle cure</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Doris Tyler has energy well beyond her 80 years. Even after retiring from her career as a music teacher, she remained active in her community — driving to church events, coming up with creative surprises for all her grandchildren.
