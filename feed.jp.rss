                <title>Aemon - Before The Wall</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Maester Aemon was on the Wall for 67 years before passing at the grand age of 102. This episode covers the ~35 years he lived in the south, and this was a particularly interesting time… He was born during the era of Blackfyre Rebellions, the Great Spring Sickness, Bloodraven, King Aerys I, Aemon’s own father King Maekar and of course - Dunk &amp;amp; Egg.
