                <title>Death in Acadia National Park.</title>
                <description>Kathy was just looking for love, but after she found it, she died under suspicious circumstances inside of Acadia National Park. Her new husband was the prime suspect.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
We love our National Parks and we know you do too but when you&#39;re out there, remember to enjoy the view but watch your back...
